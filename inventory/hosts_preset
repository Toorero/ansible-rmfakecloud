# For improved Ansible performance, SSH pipelining is enabled by default in `ansible.cfg`.
# If this causes SSH connection troubles, disable it by adding `ansible_ssh_pipelining=False`
# to the host line below or by adding `ansible_ssh_pipelining: False` to your variables file.
#
# If you're running this Ansible playbook on the same server as the one you're installing to,
# consider adding an additional `ansible_connection=local` argument to the host line below.
#
# Ansible may fail to discover which Python interpreter to use on the host for some distros (like Ubuntu 20.04).
# You may sometimes need to explicitly add the argument `ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3`
# to the host line below.
